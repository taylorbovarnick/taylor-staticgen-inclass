      Yes, it's true. Some of the most famous pirate stories, such as <a href="detail-page.html">The Pirates of the Caribbean</a> have been proven to be true. The age of piracy is long gone by now, but these logs from that golden age have been uncovered and historians have cracked them. This so-called Golden Age of Piracy lasted from approximately 1650 until 1730. These pirates of the Golden Age are known for their flashy, flamboyant attire. This includes their long beards, head wraps, flowy outfits, and their excess of lavish jewels. Historians have now confirmed that most of these jewels were uncovered in their findings in the great Caribbean Sea. This ultimately means that these jewels the pirates sport are stolen. This Golden Age has inspired movies and books and pirates have been depicted as enemies of the sea in them. The pirates are seen as greedy and yearning to find, or steal, riches. Since this time period, piracy has evovled and changed and modern day pirates do not take on the same notion as they did back in the 17th and 18th centuries. Pirate Cove and these entries divulge into the information that has been uncovered.
